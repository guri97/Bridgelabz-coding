#Given an array which may contain duplicates,print all elements and their frequencies.
ALGORITHM-1:-
step-1: create a variables for initialisation
        Expected output: ten=0
                         twenty=0
                         five=0
Step-2: create an array in which contain duplicate elements 
        Expected output-( 10 20 20 10 10 20 5 20)
Step-3: count the duplicate elements and store that elements                  in variables by using for loop.
        Expected output: ten : 3
                         twenty : 4
                         five : 1                
Step-4: print the results
        Expected output: 10:3
                         20:4
                          5:1
#ARITHMETIC COMPUTATION & SORTING 
ALGORITHM-2:-
Step-1: Read the three inputs like a,b,c
        Expected output: a=1
                         b=2
                         c=3
Step-2: compute a+b*c
        Expected output:1+2*3=7
Step-3: compute a*b+c
        Expected output:1*2+3=5
Step-4: compute c+a/b
        Expected output:3+1/2=3.5
Step-5: compute a%b+c
       Expected output:1%2+3=4
Step-6: Store the results in a dictionary for every computation
Step-7: Read the values from the dictionary into the array
Step-8: Sort the results to show the computation result in the                Descending order
Step-9: Sort the results to show the computation result in the                ascending order
